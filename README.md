General Information
The aim of the current study is to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of approach-avoidance (AA) training on stimulus evaluations. AA training effects refer to the observation that the repeated performance of approach movements in response to a specific stimulus and avoidance movements in response to another stimulus causes an implicit and explicit preference for the former stimulus. A number of different explanations for these effects have been described, e.g.:
1.	Common-coding account: 
This account builds on the assumption that sensory events and action events are represented in memory by means of structurally identical event codes (Hommel, 2004). During the performance of valenced actions, codes of positive or negative valence will be activated. These codes are bound to stimulus representations when these stimulus representations are activated at the same time. As a result, presentation of a stimulus that has previously been approached or avoided may lead to the activation of valenced codes and evoke an evaluative response that is in line with the valence of the performed action (see Eder & Klauer, 2009). 
2.	Inferential account:
This account assumes that repeated performance of approach or avoidance actions in response to a stimulus may prompt participants to infer that a stimulus is positive (in the case of approach actions) or negative (in the case of avoidance actions) (see Van Dessel et al., 2016). As a result, participants’ implicit and explicit evaluative responses to the approached stimulus will be more positive than their evaluative responses to the avoided stimulus. 
In the current experiment, we test whether AA training effects might critically depend on the activation of valenced action codes. To this end, participants are provided with training in which they move a manikin ‘upward’ or ‘downward’ in response to four different nonwords. Importantly, the upward or downward movements will either involve the manikin moving closer to the nonword or moving away from the nonword. We examine whether there is an added effect on stimulus evaluations when the training involves moving towards or away from the stimulus. 

The common-coding account predicts no added effect: Effects should depend on the activation of valenced action codes. Because upward and downward movements have a positive and negative code, respectively, and these codes are more salient in the current task, these actions should fuel the effect on evaluation and moving towards or away from the nonword should not produce any additional effect. 
In contrast, an inferential account predicts an added effect of moving towards or away from the nonword: Participants’ evaluation of nonwords will be more positive when the action involves moving the manikin towards rather than away from the nonword because this allows participants to more easily infer that this nonword is more positive (e.g., because they now that typically approached stimuli are liked more).

Hypotheses

According to a common-coding account, we would expect to see no differences between the two IAT scores.  We would also expect no effect of the Distance Change (approach/avoid) factor on explicit ratings. We do expect a main effect of Movement (up/down). That is, there will be an overall preference for the nonwords in response to which participants performed an upward movement and this effect should not be different  when these movements involved a movement towards or away from the nonwords.
According to an inferential account, we would expect a difference in IAT scores. That is, participants may exhibit a stronger preference for the word they responded to with an upward movement when this movement involved a movement towards the nonword compared to when this movement involved a movement away from the nonword. On explicit rating scores we expect a main effect of Distance Change (approach/avoid): Participants rate an approached word as more positive than an avoided word. The inferential account does not make specific predictions about the occurrence of a main effect of Movement.  


Design of the Experiment
Within-subjects design: 
Design is a 2 (move the nonword upwards/downwards) x 2 (approach/avoid the nonword) within-subjects design:
 
- Each participant receives instructions to move a manikin upwards in response to two nonwords and downwards in response to two other nonwords. 

- One of each type of nonword will consistently be approached (i.e., the manikin moves towards the nonword) and the other nonword will consistently be avoided (i.e., the manikin moves away from the nonword). 
Counterbalanced factors:
- The nonwords are UDIBNON, BAYRAM, ENANWAL, and LOKANTA. Assignment of the 4 actions to the 4 nonwords will be counterbalanced across participants. 
- The order of IAT and explicit evaluation task will be counterbalanced.
- The order of the 2 IATs will be counterbalanced.

Participants: 
Data-collection will be via the Prolific website (https://prolific.ac/). We will stop data-collection as soon as 250 participants have completed the experiment on the Prolific website. This will allow us to have sufficient power to obtain small effects of the within-subjects factor even after exclusion of participants with incorrect memory of the actions (Necessary sample size = 156 to have power = 0.80 to find a within-subjects effect of dz = 0.20 at alpha = 0.95).
Procedure: 
1. Instructions for the approach-avoidance training task:

Participants are informed that on each trial they will see a manikin as well as one of four meaningless words: UDIBNON, BAYRAM, and ENANWAL, and LOKANTA. 
Similar to Krieglmeyer, Deutsch, De Houwer, & De Raedt (2010), participants are instructed to imagine being the manikin and to move with that manikin by pressing the up and down keys of the keyboard. 
Participants are instructed to move the manikin upward when they see the word BAYRAM and ENANWAL and to move the manikin downward when they see the word UDIBNON and LOKANTA. (Note: Assignment of the actions to the nonwords is counterbalanced).
Similar to Eder & Rothermund (2008) participants are also informed that on some trials the words UP or DOWN will be presented on the screen and participants have to respond by pressing the corresponding keys of the keyboard.
2. Participants perform the approach-avoidance Training Task:
In this task there are two blocks in which each of the 4 nonwords is presented on 20 trials. The words UP and DOWN are each presented on 10 trials (20/100 trials per block = 20%). 
Importantly, for two nonwords, the manikin always appears above the nonword: an upward movement is a movement away from the word (avoided nonword: e.g., BAYRAM) and a downward movement  is a movement towards the word (approached nonword: e.g., UDIBNON). 




For the other nonwords, the manikin always appears below the nonword such that an upward movement is also a movement towards the word (approached nonword: e.g., ENANWAL) and a downward movement  is a movement away from the word (avoided nonword: e.g., LOKANTA).








3. Participants perform two IATs measuring implicit evaluations of the stimuli: 

IAT 1 involves categories “BAYRAM” (avoid + up) and “UDIBNON” (approach + down). IAT 2 involves categories “ENANWAL”(approach + up) and “LOKANTA” (avoid + down). 

IAT Procedure: 

a. Instructions: “In the next task, you will categorize words or images into groups as fast as you can. This part of the study will take about 5 minutes. On each trial, a word will be displayed, and you must assign it to one of two categories by pressing a left key (e) or a right key (i). Avoid distractions and stay focused.”
b. 16 practice trials sorting the target words (e.g., BAYRAM and UDIBNON). 
c. 16 practice trials sorting positive and negative stimuli.
d. 32 + 32 test trials in which UDIBNON and positive stimuli share a single response key and BAYRAM and negative stimuli share a single response key. 
e. 16 practice trials sorting the target words with the response key assignment reversed 
f. 32 + 32 trials in which UDIBNON shares a response key with negative and BAYRAM shares a response key with positive. 
NOTE: IAT stimuli are:
BAYRAM	The word 'BAYRAM' in 8 different fonts and sizes
UDIBNON	The word 'UDIBNON' in 8 different fonts and sizes
Positive	Beautiful, Glorious, Marvelous, Success, Wonderful
Negative	Agony, Evil, Failure, Sadness, Unpleasant
4. Participants give explicit ratings for the two nonwords by answering the question: 

 	 “How pleasant or unpleasant do you find the word UDIBNON/BAYRAM/…?” 
 	  (1: Extremely unpleasant -9: Extremely pleasant)

5. Participants answer the following questions:

 	a.  “What action did you perform when you saw the word UDIBNON/BAYRAM/…?” 
 	(move up/ move down/I don’t remember).

 	 For each word this question is followed by: 

 	“Did this action result in a movement of the manikin towards or away from the word?” 
 	(towards/ away/I don’t remember)

 	b.  “How positive or negative do you find the word UP/DOWN” ? 
 	(1: Extremely negative -9: Extremely positive) ?

Data Analysis Plan Experiment
Data-preparation: 
Similar to previous studies (e.g., Van Dessel, De Houwer, Gast, & Smith, 2015):

1.  the data of participants who do not correctly answer the memory questions will be excluded from analyses (we will report whether this exclusion changed the results).
2. The data of participants who do not fully complete all questions and tasks will be excluded from analyses. 
3. The data will be excluded of participants who had IAT error rates for any of the IATs above 30% across the entire task, or above 40% for any one of the four critical blocks or for participants who complete more than 10% of IAT trials faster than 400 ms.
4. The D4 algorithm will be used to create IAT scores. These scores will be computed such that they indicate a more positive evaluation for the word that participants had to respond to by pushing the ‘up’ key.
Additionally, the data of participants with error rates > 30% in the label trials are removed because this might provide an indication that participants internally recoded the approach-avoidance responses.
Data-analyses: 
A paired t-test will be performed on the two IAT scores to test for the effect of distance change over and above the effect of moving upward vs downward. We will compute Bayesian factors in accordance with procedures outlined by Rouder, Speckman, Sun, Morey, and Iverson (2009) to estimate the amount of evidence for the hypothesis that there is a difference between IAT scores (alternative hypothesis) or that there is no difference (null hypothesis). 
The explicit liking scores will be subjected to a 2 (Distance Change: approach/avoid) x 2 (upward/downward) within-subjects ANOVA and we will explore the interaction with paired t-tests.
Cohen’s d will be reported for all of the comparisons.
